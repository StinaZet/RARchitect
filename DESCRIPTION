Description: A framework for simulating Response-Adaptive Randomization (RAR) 
  clinical trial designs for different types of outcomes. Its purpose is to 
  assist researchers and statisticians in designing RAR trials by allowing them 
  to test various configurations and parameters, such as prior settings, 
  allocation tuning and clipping strategies, and recruitment rates, through simulations.
